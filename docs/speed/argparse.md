# `argparse` Module

## Overview

The `argparse` module  in the `speed` library provides utilities to write user-friendly 
command-line interfaces. The program defines what arguments it requires, and argparse will figure 
out how to parse those out of argc and argv. The argparse module also automatically generates help, 
usage messages and issues errors when users give the program invalid arguments.

## Acknowledgement

The implementation of this argument parser has been influenced by many projects and people.

I want to thank the programmers who worked on the Python module
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html">argparse</a>, as discovering and using 
this library in 2015 inspired me to start this project.

I also want to specially thank <a href="https://github.com/p-ranav">p-ranav</a> for their work on 
their argument parser, as discovering their project gave me many ideas and insights into how to 
make a good argument parser.
